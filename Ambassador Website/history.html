    <h1>The Ambassador: A Houghton Favorite</h1>
    <h2>The city of Houghton boasts a strong Finnish heritage– defunct yet
      aesthetically eye-catching architecture, huge amounts of snow,
      a gorgeous lake and some really good restaurants.</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="text-1">
    <h2>January 25, 2018</h2>
    <p>One such magnificent bistro that has stood against the test of time,
      preserving its authenticity for more than half a century since it was
      first established. The Ambassador, or “The Ambo” as it is affectionately
      called, is currently the first choice of dining in Houghton. It has a rich
      and colorful history which makes this place unique by its own making.</p>
      <p>The Ambassador opened under new management on New Year’s Eve of 1965 when Marian and Joe “Chinko” Rossi took over control of a small bar in the downtown area. The Rossi family then transformed this tap bar of former times into a specialized pizza and sandwich delicatessen. Prior to the birth of this diner, the Rossi family owned a small restaurant in San Francisco but moved to the Upper Peninsula in search of better prospects. At the time of purchase, Marian Rossi wrote a poem called “Come Fill a Bumper” which records the abridged history of the place with the bar murals as the focal point and now graces the cover of the menu. The poem reveals that Joseph Bosch, a German painter of the former Bosch Brewing Company was asked to paint those murals exclusively for the brewery. Mr. Rohrbeck, the former owner, had the oil paintings varnished to preserve them. The Rossi couple began implementing some iconoclastic changes immediately after by selling the beer in bottles.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-2">
    <p>They then also began serving food– pizza being their specialty. To this day, the Rossi family still uses the same recipe. Along with the pizzas, they began the menu modestly with an assorted combination of ten types of sandwiches. The list ranged from beef (from the rotisserie), their traditional submarines, to Braunswiegers. The bread was exclusively supplied by the Crown, and then by the Thurner’s Bakery. After setting up their foothold as a haven for gourmands, the redecoration commenced with the addition of a wood-burning fireplace to mellow the harsh winters. Until the 80s, the kitchen was open and utilized the southeast corner. Soon after, the rights of the entire building were acquired and improvements in décor to enhance the ambiance were made.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-3">
    <p>The huge ornamental paintings around the walls correlate with the element of the restaurant against the backdrop of the rich, greenish-yellow colored light from the murals, which are framed with dark mahogany, and the stained glass windows, along with the low hanging chandeliers, gave the place a medieval, inn-like atmosphere which complements the simple, yet enchanting, cuisine. These murals are hand-painted, depicting bearded gnomes. People often ask for the story behind the paintings while enjoying the sandwiches and beer. Above the bar, Rossi’s personal favorite depicts the gnomes brewing beer in a large vat. On the next panel, the task is completed and the gnomes are seen celebrating with a game of cards and a few drinks. As the story continues, too much reveling brings on the jailers, which include a goat that gives a drunken gnome a boost into a cell. It is said that the Ambassador was not the original home for the gnomes, but that they were a creation of a Bavarian painter named T. Rohrbeck. He was hired by the Bosch brewery to paint the murals for one of their taverns, the Gilt Edge Bar, which lies close to the Ambassador. During prohibition, the sale of beer was discontinued and the paintings were taken down and stored at the Bosch home in Lake Linden. When the prohibition ended, the Ambassador opened up, giving life again to the paintings with a regular bath of linseed oil to soothe the cracks in the canvas.</p>

  <div class="text-4">
    <p>To explain the history of the Ambassador and the unique murals that line the interior walls, the owners conducted research and wrote a poem detailing the story. The poem, entitled "Come Fill a Bumper," has since been printed on the cover of the Ambassador menu.</p>
    <h2>Come Fill a Bumper</h2>
    <i>On or about nineteen hundred and two, Mr. Rohrbeck was given a job to do.  With brushes in hand and gnomes in his head, he created the masterpiece on the wall above. First home for the paintings was the old Giltedge Bar, east of here, but not too far.  Streets were of dirt, sidewalks of wood, hitching posts for horses, business was good.  Beer for a nickel, whiskey for a dime, sandwiches a quarter any old time. Prohibition was next, and became the law, the Ambassador, a speakeasy, called “Hole in the Wall.” Paintings were rolled and stored away, for twelve long years in the dust they lay.  At last came nineteen thirty-three, the law was repealed and Bacchus was free.  Saloons and taverns opened their doors, folks danced, sang, and drank spirits once more. The old bar was hauled out of its storage place, and the paintings were hung on the walls they now grace. The artist, long gone, would be proud if he knew, that folks still enjoy them as much as they do.</i>
